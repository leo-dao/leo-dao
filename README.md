### Hey ✌️ 

Hi I'm Leo, I'm a second year Computer Science undergraduate student at McGill and I'm currently working on a peer-to-peer music rental website.

I'm using React JS and Ant Design to build a frontend and intend on building a backend using SQL. Starting this project has allowed me to: further my **JavaScript/TypeScript** skills, learn to properly use git, and overall improve my problem solving skills.

I'm looking forward to building my own website from the ground up! 👷‍♂️

* Python 

  * Selenium

* Java

* Bash
  
  * Awk

* MIPS Assembly Language ~~unfortunately~~
