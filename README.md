## Hi, I'm Leo! 👋

I'm a final year Computer Science undergraduate student at McGill University who likes to create cool projects whenever inspiration strikes! Welcome to my GitHub repository, where you can find a collection of projects I've worked on. Here are some highlights:

🎸 **[AirGnB](https://github.com/leo-dao/AirGnB)**: A peer-to-peer music rental website built with React and Django.

🌐 **Three.js Projects**: *[Colliding Molecules](https://github.com/leo-dao/colliding-molecules)* which involves collision detection and grouping new objects together, and *[Weather Visualiser](https://github.com/leo-dao/weather-visualizer)*, where I made my (rough) blender debut!

🕷️ **Scrapy Web Scraping**: I've dabbled in web scraping with Scrapy, and you can find my *[Comedian Scraper](https://github.com/leo-dao/comedian-scraper)* project here with the results of my findings in the JSON file.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas. 🚀
